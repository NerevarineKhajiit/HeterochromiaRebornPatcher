# HeterochromiaRebornPatcher
Heterochromia Reborn Patcher

For use in conjunction with the RaceMenu ini files available on my mod page on Nexusmods. This patcher will process Texture Sets available for Eye models in Skyrim and convert them to new headpart models that can be independently selected via new Left Eye Color and Right Eye Color sliders.
